"""Out-of-process WebRTC video relay (GPU-resident gst grab + aiortc).

Sending video from inside the teleop process measurably starves the
control loops: pushing thousands of RTP packets per second plus encoding
is real CPU/GIL work, and it stretches the IK round-trip the moment a
headset connects. The same isolation pattern used for the IK solver
applies here — video runs in a dedicated subprocess and the control
process never touches it.

The subprocess owns the ZED cameras through :mod:`almond_axol.video.gst_zed`:
the ``zedxonesrc`` / ``zedsrc`` GStreamer elements grab and NVENC-encode
entirely on the GPU, and Python only ever sees the encoded H.264 access
units, which aiortc forwards as pre-encoded packets (no Python encode step).
If the gst stack is unavailable the relay falls back to the ZED SDK grab +
in-Python NVENC path (``hw_video``). Either way aiortc owns the ICE / DTLS /
SRTP transport, which connects reliably on this multi-homed LAN where
gstreamer ``webrtcbin``'s libnice stalls. WebRTC media flows over the
subprocess's own UDP sockets, so the only traffic crossing the process
boundary is SDP signaling (a few messages per headset connection) over a
``multiprocessing`` pipe.

:class:`VideoRelayProcess` is the parent-side handle. It implements the
same async interface as ``WebRTCManager`` (``create_offer`` /
``set_answer`` / ``close`` / ``close_all`` / ``has_sources``), so
``VRServer.set_video_manager`` can use it as a drop-in.
