axol collect-data

Record teleoperation episodes with the Axol robot and its local ZED cameras.
Episode boundaries are driven by VR controller commands:
  - DATA_COLLECTION → RECORDING:              start collecting frames
  - RECORDING → DATA_COLLECTION:              stop; save episode (success)
  - RECORDING → DATA_COLLECTION + reset btn:  stop; discard episode (rerecord)

While saving, the VR headset is pushed into the SAVING state so recording
controls are blocked until save_episode() completes.

Recording continues until Ctrl+C.

The teleop loop runs at ``--teleop_hz`` and publishes the latest
``(joint_obs, action)`` snapshot every tick. The dataset itself — frame
capture, row assembly, encoding, ``save_episode`` — is owned by a separate
recorder (see :mod:`almond_axol.cli.record_proc`): a subprocess when the video
relay is up (so the per-frame work never shares the GIL with the control loop),
or in-process as a fallback when there is no relay. Either way each recorded
frame is aligned to the joint sample by its shared ``perf_counter`` capture
timestamp.
